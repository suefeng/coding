Have you ever wondered how programs on your computer and the websites you visit “talk” to each other? To understand that, we first have to delve into the weird and wonderful world of APIs, or Application Programing Interfaces.

## What is An API

The phrase API appears regularly in computer-science fields. But what does it mean? Well, definitively put, it refers to a tool, or library, that assists developers in writing code that interfaces with other software. These can range from the low-level tools that allow Windows and OS X applications to use aspects of the underlying operating system, to those powering the apps on your phone. In short, it defines a way in which a computer program communicates with another computer program.

But APIs aren’t inherently interesting. The application of these tools is what really matters. Here’s how APIs are making the web awesome, opening up governments, and increasing consumer choice.

## APIs in Business

You might assume that the technology world is inherently cut-throat, with incumbents not wishing to provide a leg-up to the competition. But you’d be wrong. Indeed, many large technology firms, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook, even allow the use of their service by third parties and competitors.
Yes, there’s a genuinely compelling commercial reason why a competitor would release an API, and then have allow anyone to use it. With respect to Facebook and Twitter, we see how third parties have enriched these services with their own code. A great example of this is seen in  [Klout](http://klout.com/) , which allows developers to measure their social influence, find influential people in their spheres of interest, and schedule Tweets and Facebook postings.
