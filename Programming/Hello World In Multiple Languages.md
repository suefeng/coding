# Hello World in multiple languages

## [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))

Something that made Java special is that it was designed so you could write code once and then allow it to run on any operation system. Java is the most popular programming language in the world. It’s used to teach students and in large companies. All Android apps are written in Java.

``` Java
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String\[\] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Prints the string to the console.
    }
}
```

## [JavaScript (ECMAScript)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

JavaScript is the most commonly found programming language in the world. Mainly because it is required to be in every web browser. JavaScript is what makes the web dynamic and interactive. It was standardised under the name ECMAScript.

``` javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

## [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)

Not so much a language (the language used is JavaScript) but a runtime environment to run JavaScript on servers as opposed to browsers. The goal was to demonstrate that asynchronous programming was better for modern multi-core CPUs. It now gets used a great deal for tooling of large front-end projects.

``` javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

## [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)

PHP is the most popular language for building the backend of websites. It’s what Facebook and WordPress are written in. Facebook decided to create their own dialect of PHP called [Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_(programming_language)).

``` php
<?php echo "Hello, World";
```

## [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

Has a compact syntax needing far fewer lines of code than languages like Java or C++. It’s very popular and is used for websites and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.

``` python
print("Hello World")
```

## [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language))

Designed to be a productive and fun language to use, stressing human needs over computer needs. The Rails web framework was written for Ruby, and had a huge impact on web framework design. Ruby is still a popular language for creating websites.

``` ruby
puts 'Hello World!'
```
